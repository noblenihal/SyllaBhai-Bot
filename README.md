Finally deployed my Telegram Bot, SyllaBhai !
Bot Link - https://t.me/SyllaBhai_bot
.
Purpose of the bot was to extract the syllabus of each and every subject in each semester for every BTech branch offered by Maharaja Surajmal Institute Of Technology , affiliated by Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University from the PDF provided by the university.

On 26th Jan, I started studying for my upcoming semester exams, now obviously I have to look at the syllabus. That day I was feeling little lazy, so the process of going to the website page, looking for the students section, scrolling through the page to find my course, then my branch, then scrolling through the PDF to finally get the subject I was looking for , was tiresome to me.

So I thought why not create a Telegram bot that can help me to avoid all these steps and I can get the syllabus for the subject that I am looking for , then I created one using Python language. I shared it with my classmates, they seemed to like it. Then I thought why not for the whole college ! ðŸ˜ƒ

And there you go, deployed the fully functional bot that is not only helping me but the whole college. People are loving it ðŸ’œ Thanks to everyone who appreciated my work.

Now I can start studying peacefully ðŸ˜Œ
